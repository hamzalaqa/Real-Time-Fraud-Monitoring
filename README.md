[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v1.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/hamzalaqa/Real-Time-Fraud-Monitoring/releases)

## üì¶ Introduction

The Real-Time Fraud Monitoring System helps identify fraudulent transactions quickly. It uses machine learning and streams data using Apache Kafka. The system runs in Docker, making it easy to set up and use. This application features XGBoost for fraud detection, SHAP explainability for insights, and a React-based dashboard for easy viewing. 

This application is ideal for educational purposes and demonstrations. 

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Real-Time Fraud Monitoring System.

### 1. System Requirements

Make sure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS Catalina or later, or a recent Linux distribution
- **CPU:** Minimum dual-core processor
- **RAM:** At least 4 GB
- **Disk Space:** At least 1 GB free
- **Docker:** Make sure you have Docker installed and running.

### 2. Download & Install

To download the software, visit the following link:

[Download from Releases](https://github.com/hamzalaqa/Real-Time-Fraud-Monitoring/releases)

After downloading, find the file that matches your operating system. Typical files include:

- **Windows:** `fraud_monitor.exe`
- **macOS:** `fraud_monitor.dmg`
- **Linux:** `fraud_monitor.deb` or `fraud_monitor.tar.gz`

### 3. Setup Docker

If you have not yet installed Docker, follow the steps below:

1. Visit the [Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Follow the instructions that match your operating system.
3. After installation, open Docker to ensure it is running.

### 4. Run the Application

Once you have Docker running, follow these steps to start the application:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Change directory to where you downloaded the file.
3. Run the following command to start the Docker container:

   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Once the services are running, open your web browser.
5. Go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard.

## üìä Features

The Real-Time Fraud Monitoring System includes:

- **Fraud Detection:** Uses advanced algorithms to identify potential fraud in real time.
- **Data Visualization:** The modern React dashboard shows trends and potential issues clearly.
- **Scalability:** Easily adapts to increasing amounts of data as your needs grow.
- **Explainable AI:** SHAP provides insights into the model's decision-making process.

## üåê How It Works

This application listens for financial transactions and applies machine learning models to predict fraud. Here is how it works:

1. **Data Streaming:** Transactions are streamed using Apache Kafka.
2. **Model Prediction:** The application applies the XGBoost algorithm to each transaction, predicting whether it is fraudulent or trustworthy.
3. **User Interface:** The results show on the React dashboard, allowing users to act quickly.
